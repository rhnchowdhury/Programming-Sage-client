        "details": "C is a procedural programming language. It was initially developed by Dennis Ritchie as a system programming language to write operating system. C programming is considered as the base for other programming languages, that is why it is known as mother language. C programs are very efficient because they contain a variety of data types and robust operators. C was initially used for system development work, particularly the programs that make-up the operating system. C was adopted as a system development language because it produces code that runs nearly as fast as the code written in assembly language.",

This tutorial helps you to build your base with PHP. PHP script is executed much faster than those scripts which are written in other languages such as JSP and ASP. PHP uses its own memory, so the server workload and loading time is automatically reduced, which results in faster processing speed and better performance.PHP supports all the leading databases such as MySQL, SQLite, ODBC, etc",

Kotlin is designed to interoperate fully with Java, and the JVM version of Kotlin's standard library depends on the Java Class Library, but type inference allows its syntax to be more concise. Kotlin Application Deployment is faster to compile, lightweight, and prevents applications from increasing size. Any chunk of code written in it is much smaller compared to it, as it is less verbose and less code means fewer bugs. It compiles the code to a bytecode which can be executed in the JVM. Starting with Android 9 (API level 28), the Android SDK contains nullability annotations to help avoid NullPointerExceptions. API reference documentation is also available in Kotlin.",
